## Overview
In this project, we aim to develop a model that can accurately predict mortgage interest rates based on a variety of factors. Mortgage interest rates play a critical role in the housing market, affecting everything from affordability for homebuyers to the profitability of real estate investments. 

## Data Collection
The first component of our project was to find a dataset that included mortgage interest rates and multiple factors that influence interest rates. We decided to use ChatGPT to help design the appropriate dataset. The following was the prompt that was entered into ChatGPT:

"I need a data set for mortgage interest rates. I need a variety of factors that would determine interest rates of a mortgage, preferebly 10 or more. Can you create a data set for me that is at least 1000 rows"

ChatGPT gave us code that would create a 1000-row dataframe with interest rates and multiple factors that influence interest rate.
