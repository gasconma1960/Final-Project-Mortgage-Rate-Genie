 Predict the interes rate using different Machine Learning
 By: Christy, Marisol, Stephanie, Maria & Omie


## Overview

Our purpose for this assignment is to be able to help users calculate their mortgage interest rates based off income, debt to income, credit score and other contributing factors. The process of buying a house can be stressful but rewarding and we want users to feel they can have an accurate calculation based on market and other factors. So we ask ourself, what factors determine your interest rate? 

# Analysis 
Database can store all the data from an imported csv. We were having trouble on finding the right kind of data for this project, which became challenging in the beginning. We decided to utilize ChatGPT to help compile a dataset with the following question:

"I need a data set for mortgage interest rates. I need a variety of factors that would determine interest rates of a mortgage, preferebly 10 or more. Can you create a data set for me that is at least 1000 rows"

Taking the code that was created by ChapGPT to create a random data for the 1000 rows created, we cleaned the data making sure there were no null or negative values. The calculation for the interest rate needed some modifications done. We believe that some if the interest rates used in the dataset did not make sense based on the contributing factors. 
This recalculation was able to reflect interest rates that seem reasonable for the current market despite the data being generated by ChatGPT

# Calculate interest rates
interest_rate = [round(random.uniform(2.5, 5.5) + (credit_score[i]/100) - (loan_to_value[i]*0.1) - (loan_term[i]*0.2), 2) for i in range(1000)]

After the cleaning, we imported the csv into PGAdmin4 to create the tables based on the data types. As you can see below, the image dispalys the column of our dataset.
 
 Below is the table for the imported data

 From the main data table, we created small subtables for each of the following categories that had running intergers and generated the MIN, MAX, and AVG of each category. 
 
 This is an example of the summary table

 # Conlusion 
 
 To closure, our goal is to integrate the dataset with machine learning and visualize our project in a webpage using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
 We want to be incorporate our data as well as giving users an opportunity to calculate their future mortgage payment based on our dataset
